  <h2>Charles Jonel</h2>
  <p>Hello everyone. My name, as mentioned, is Charles Jonel. Haiti is my birthplace and that is where I live too. I am from a family of six: my parents, one brother, and two sisters. My brother and one of my sisters are members of the Church. I have been a member of the church for eight years, and I keep praying that my parents receive this gospel while in the flesh. Meanwhile, I am doing my best to become a better person.</p>
  <p>I entered Brigham Young University Idaho thanks to the pathway program. It is a great program. It offers so much opportunity to people, almost all over the world.</p>
  <p>I chose Business Management as my major when I enrolled. The expansion of the remote job market are making me thinking a lot those last days. Maybe, I will change my major. There is much more opportunities to work remotely, wherever you may live, and I want to take advantage of that. Becoming a web developer is a goal that I am trying to attain for a long time, as a self-taught, but this time I am determined to realise it.</p>
  <p>Things might get difficult sometimes but with faith, hard work and a good planning we will succeed at the end.</p>
